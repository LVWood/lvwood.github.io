                        <br><p>CHALLENGES: the site's pre-existing branding (logo, colors) were used haphazardly and without a formal style-guide. It relied on low-quality, non-scalable images and had not been updated in some time. Additionally, the site was hosted and managed by a 3rd party company and any design updates would need to adhere to the template and data structure already in use.</p>
