                        <p>THE BRIEF: redesign a pre-existing commercial website in order to modernize the firm's branding and online presence. A well-respected company with a loyal but aging clientele, they needed an updated online presence in order to satisfy a new generation of clients.</p>
                        <br><p>REWARDS: for a venerable antiquarian firm with over 40 years in the business, it was a rewarding challenge to freshen and simplify the site while maintaining familiar brand identity.</p>
                        <br><p>CHALLENGES: the site's pre-existing branding (logo, colors) were used haphazardly and without a formal style-guide. It relied on low-quality, non-scalable images and had not been updated in some time. Additionally, the site was hosted and managed by a 3rd party company and any design updates would need to adhere to the template and data structure already in use.</p>
