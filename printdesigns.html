                        <h4>Serenade Magazine</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>Serenade is published annually to showcase news and accomplishments of KU School of Music students, faculty, and alumni. As the school's primary publication, the magazine is key resource for student recruitment, alumni  relations, and development.</p>
                        <br><p>CHALLENGE: limited real estate combined with an abundance of stories left us with very little visual "breathing room", resulting in several spreads housing 3 or even 4 separate articles.</p>
                        <br><p>REWARD: an abundance of dynamic candid photos and stories submitted by students and staff lent freshness and enthusiasm to the project, so even crowded layouts had energy and optimism.</p>

                  <p>THE BRIEF: redesign a pre-existing commercial website in order to modernize the firm's branding and online presence. A well-respected company with a loyal but aging clientele, they needed an updated online presence in order to satisfy a new generation of clients.</p>
                  <br><p>REWARDS: for a venerable antiquarian firm with over 40 years in the business, it was a rewarding challenge to freshen and simplify the site while maintaining familiar brand identity.</p>
                  <br><p>CHALLENGES: the site's pre-existing branding (logo, colors) were used haphazardly and without a formal style-guide. It relied on low-quality, non-scalable images and had not been updated in some time. Additionally, the site was hosted and managed by a 3rd party company and any design updates would need to adhere to the template and data structure already in use.</p>
